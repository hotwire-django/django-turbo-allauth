## Hotwired/Turbo django-allauth integration

This package provides subclasses modifying the django-allauth views https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth to provide valid return codes.

This package is required in order to provide allauth compatability with Turbo. Turbo form validation either setting the attribute *data-turbo="false"* in the form, or returning a 4** response. This provides subclasses for the latter.

**Disclaimer**: the Hotwired/Turbo client libraries are, at time of writing, still in Beta. We expect there will be breaking changes until the first stable release. This package, and the Turbo client, should therefore be used with caution in a production environment. The version used in testing is *@hotwired/turbo==7.0.0-beta.4*.

## Requirements

This library is tested for Python 3.8+ and Django 3.0+.

## Installation

> pip install django-turbo-allauth
